Description: Network script kwdjbdns_update
 kwdjbdns_updates is a perl script dhcpd-to-tinydns update daemon.
 .
 kwdjbdns_update: This script reads a dhcpd.leases file and
 dynamically updates tinydns with hostname and ip information.
 .
 It assumes that your DHCP server recieves hostnames from the
 clients, and that your clients offer their hostnames to the server.
 Some versions of Linux DHCP clients don't do that. This used ISC's
 DHCPD, found at http://www.isc.org - though others may work just
 fine.
